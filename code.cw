#delay-per-command = 1
#Hello there :), this is a example code for the Codewave CW language. the delay-per-command is just a delay on how many seconds before running another command. if you want to disable this please put 0, and also the delay should only be intergers. you can run basic code here. and load it with this command: /load <path>, and the delay per command, should only be in line 1. please delete this if your gonna code on here. Thank you using CodeWave.
