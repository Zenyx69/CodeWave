# CodeWave Prompt

The CodeWave Prompt is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance your coding experience. It offers a range of features and functionalities that help streamline your workflow and improve productivity.

## Features

- **Custom Logging**: Use the `/log` command to post your own log messages, making it easy to track and document your progress during coding sessions.

- **Prompt Clearing**: With the `/clear` command, you can quickly clear the entire prompt, providing a clean slate for your next set of commands.

- **Delay Control**: The `/wait` command allows you to introduce delays, specifying the number of seconds to wait before executing the next command. This is particularly useful when you need to synchronize operations or create time intervals between commands.

- **Script File Execution**: Use the `/load` command to execute script files with the `.cw` extension. This feature enables you to automate repetitive tasks or execute a series of predefined commands from a file.

- **Conditional Command Execution**: The `/execute` command enables you to perform conditional command execution. You can specify an `if` statement with `==` or `!=` comparisons, allowing you to control the flow of your commands based on variable values or specific conditions.
